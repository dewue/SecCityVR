# SecCityVR
## Visualization and Collaborative Exploration of Software Vulnerabilities in Virtual Reality
SecCityVR was developed as a proof-of-concept implementation, that employs the code city metaphor within VR to visualize software security vulnerabilities as colored building floors inside the surrounding virtual city. By integrating the applicationâ€™s call graph, vulnerabilities are contextualized within related software components. SecCityVR supports multi-user collaboration and interactive exploration. It provides explanations and mitigations for detected issues.
